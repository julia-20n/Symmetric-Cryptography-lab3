## Cryptanalysis of affine bigram substitution

## Purpose of the work

To learn methods of frequency cryptanalysis. To acquire skills in working with modular arithmetic and analysing monoalphabetic substitution ciphers using the example of an affine bigram substitution cipher. 

## Problem statement

Implement software tools for decrypting an affine bigram cipher based on frequency analysis, as well as tools for automatically checking the content of the decrypted text.
